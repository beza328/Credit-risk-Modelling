# Credit-risk-Modelling
## Project Overview

### This project involves the creation of a Credit Scoring Model for Bati Bank in collaboration with an eCommerce partner. The objective is to enable a buy-now-pay-later service, which allows customers to purchase products on credit if they qualify based on their credit score. The model aims to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers by predicting whether they will default in the future.

### Credit scoring is a crucial process for evaluating applicantsâ€™ risk levels by analyzing historical data of previous borrowers and using it to predict future behavior. This model will help Bati Bank determine who qualifies for the buy-now-pay-later service.
Key Steps:
## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA provides a detailed analysis of the dataset, ensuring a good understanding of the structure and characteristics of the data. The following steps were completed during EDA:

   ### Overview of the Data:
We reviewed the dataset structure (number of rows, columns, and data types) using .info() and .describe().

  ### Summary Statistics:
Generated descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, min, max, standard deviation) to understand the central tendency and variability of numerical features.

  ### Distribution of Numerical Features:
Used histograms and kernel density plots (KDE) to visualize the distribution of numerical features and detect skewness or patterns.

  ###  Distribution of Categorical Features:
Used bar plots to visualize the distribution of categorical features, identifying frequency and balance among different categories.

 ### Correlation Analysis:
Created a correlation matrix to examine relationships between numerical features and visualized it using a heatmap to identify strong correlations.


###  Outlier Detection:
Identified potential outliers using box plots and performed further analysis to determine their impact on the model.
